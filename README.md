Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network

## Important!

This is a project under construction. The Multilayer Perceptron neural network sketched here is not functional yet!

## Description
This an implementation of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model in ES6 programming language. 
A MLP can solve categorization and predictive analytics tasks.

## Project Structure

This project
* Compiles ES6 (with Babel)
* Linting (with ESLint)
* Build with webpack
* Test with Mocha, Chai and Sinon
* Use Karma to run the tests

The initial project structure was created using Krasimir Tsonev's great [react-webpack-starter boilerplate]!(https://github.com/krasimir/react-webpack-starter)

## Scripts

* `npm run build` - produces production version of MLP library under the `lib` folder
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of MLP library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - runs tests
* `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode

## Installation

You can install multilayer perceptron as a separate Node module:

* `npm install multilayer-perceptron`

But please note, you can't do anything useful with it yet. This is a project under construction! I continue working on this
every time I get bored or fired.
