## Scripts

* `npm run build` - produces production version of MLP library under the `lib` folder
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of MLP library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - runs tests
* `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode

## Installation

You can install multilayer perceptron as a separate Node module:

* `npm install multilayer-perceptron`

But please note, you can't do anything useful with it yet. This is a project under construction! I continue working on this
every time I get bored or fired.
